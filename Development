                <h2  class="text-information-title">WHAT IS RAINWATER HARVESTING ?</h2>
            <p>
                Rainwater harvesting is collecting the run-off from a structure or other impervious surface in order to store it for later use. Traditionally, this involves harvesting the rain from a roof. The rain will collect in gutters that channel the water into downspouts and then into some sort of storage vessel. Rainwater collection systems can be as simple as collecting rain in a rain barrel or as elaborate as harvesting rainwater into large cisterns to supply your entire household demand. <br>
                Harvesting rainwater is a practice that has been around for centuries. Cisterns and other rain harvesting systems are widely used in Europe, Australia, India, the Bahamas and countless remote countries - many who depend solely on rain for day to day life. <br>
                 
                When water supply becomes limited, practical solutions can fill the gap. Rainwater harvesting systems provide distributed stormwater runoff containment while simultaneously storing water which can be used for irrigation, flushing toilets, washing clothes, washing cars, pressure washing,or it can be purified for use as everyday drinking water. You can really take this as far as you want. But it all comes down to various filtration and processing systems.

                <h2 class="text-information-title">DETAILED INFORMATION ON RAINWATER HARVESTING</h2>
            <p class="text-information">
                <p class="text-information" style="color: burlywood;"> <ins><b>Limitations</b></ins></p> 
                <p class="text-information">
                    Rainwater harvesting is a widely used method of storing rainwater in the countries presenting with drought characteristics. Several pieces of research have derived and developed different criteria and techniques to select suitable sites for harvesting rainwater. Some research was identified and selected suitable sites for the potential erection of dams, as well as derived a model builder in ArcMap 10.4.1. The model combined several parameters, such as slope, runoff potential, land cover/use, stream order, soil quality, and hydrology to determine the suitability of the site for harvesting rainwater.[30]   
                </p>
                <p class="text-information">
                    Harvested water from RWH systems can be minimal during below-average precipitation in arid urban regions such as the Mideast. RWH is useful for developing areas as it collects water for irrigation and domestic purposes. However, the gathered water should be adequately filtered to ensure safe drinking.[31]
                </p>
                <p class="text-information" style="color: burlywood;"> <ins><b> Quality of water harvesting</b></ins></p>
                <p> Rainwater may need to be analyzed properly, and used in a way appropriate to its safety. In the Gansu province, for example, solar water disinfection is used by boiling harvested rainwater in parabolic solar cookers before being used for drinking.[32] These so-called "appropriate technology" methods provide low-cost disinfection options for treatment of stored rainwater for drinking.
                </p>

             </p>
             <p class="text-information"> 
                While rainwater itself is a clean source of water, often better than groundwater or water from rivers or lakes,[33] the process of collection and storage often leaves the water polluted and non-potable. Rainwater harvested from roofs can contain human, animal and bird feces, mosses and lichens, windblown dust, particulates from urban pollution, pesticides, and inorganic ions from the sea (Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, SO4), and dissolved gases (CO2, NOx, SOx). High levels of pesticide have been found in rainwater in Europe with the highest concentrations occurring in the first rain immediately after a dry spell;[34] the concentration of these and other contaminants are reduced significantly by diverting the initial flow of run-off water to waste. Improved water quality can also be obtained by using a floating draw-off mechanism (rather than from the base of the tank) and by using a series of tanks, withdraw from the last in series. Prefiltration is a common practice used in the industry to keep the system healthy and ensure that the water entering the tank is free of large sediments.

             </p>
             <p class="text-information">
                A very interesting concept of rainwater harvesting and cleaning it with solar energy for rural household drinking purposes has been developed by Nimbkar Agricultural Research Institute.[35]
             </p>
             <p class="text-information">
                Conceptually, a water supply system should match the quality of water with the end-user. However, in most of the developed world, high-quality potable water is used for all end uses. This approach wastes money and energy and imposes unnecessary impacts on the environment. Supplying rainwater that has gone through preliminary filtration measures for non-potable water uses, such as toilet flushing, irrigation, and laundry, maybe a significant part of a sustainable water management strategy.

             </p>
             <p class="text-information" style="color: burlywood;"> <ins><b>Research</b></ins></p>
             <p>The South African Water Research Commission has supported research into rainwater harvesting.[36] Studies in arid, semiarid, and humid regions have confirmed that techniques such as mulching, pitting, ridging, and modified run-on plots are effective for small-scale crop production.[37] Hydrofracturing has regularly been used to improve the performance of water boreholes. From 1990 to 1992, 170 boreholes had been hydrofractured.[38]

                <p class="text-information">Rainwater is cheap, and with very little trace of impurities, all personal need is to obtain storage media and rain. Water treatment costs are also low and easy to do without professionals. Rainwater harvesting provides a reliable alternative water source in areas where they experience water scarcity and an additional source where there are no problems with water allowing people to direct it towards purposes. other uses such as irrigation or electricity generation. Rainwater also drastically reduces water bills; it can be used interchangeably with ordinary water but for other tasks such as laundry that consumes large amounts of water.</p>
                <p><b>DANGEROUS RATING WATER</b></p>
                <p class="text-information">As much as water from rain is pure, it sometimes runs off surfaces that can contain impurities that can be dangerous to humans. Most homes in the developing world are made of corrugated iron sheets that rust over time; when rainwater washes away rust into the cistern, drinking this water can lead to health complications. Some roofing materials contain high levels of lead and asbestos which are toxic to the human body if consumed directly. </p>
                <p class="text-information">Some areas in the developed world are heavily industrialized which means very high levels of air pollution. When rainwater mixes with certain chemicals in the air, the water becomes acidic and unsuitable for use. Untreated rainwater is the source of dangerous waterborne diseases such as skin poisoning and cholera that can lead to death if left untreated.</p>

                    <p class="text-information" style="padding-top: 10px;">It is not natural that since its appearance, stainless steel water tanks are preferred. Because there are many outstanding advantages compared to other types of material water tanks that have appeared before.</p>
                    <p class="text-information">Ensure the safety of the water source: The water tank is usually located on a high place (the terrace or the roof), so the temperature of the water may be abnormally hot/cold. Because stainless steel can be affected by solar heat. However, whether the temperature is high or low, the water quality is still the same, ensuring safety for the family to use.</p>
                    <p class="text-information">Durability comes with time: 3 decades ago, stainless steel water tanks began to be widely used. Because of the durability of stainless steel, the use time can be up to dozens of years (maximum 30 years). Moreover, stainless steel tanks are difficult to be shaken and shaken when external forces occur (such as rain, wind, storm, ...).</p>
                    <p class="text-information">Many different sizes and capacities: Stainless steel tanks are also preferred because they are manufactured in different sizes. Because each family will have different number of members and needs. Previously, water tanks of other materials only had a few sizes, leading to a lack of - excess when used. But with the variety of stainless steel sinks, any family can find a suitable capacity.</p>
                    <p class="text-information">Many places to sell and buy easily: Currently, almost all construction stores sell stainless steel water tanks. Therefore, you can find and buy easily, without having to transport as far as before.</p>
                    <b><ins>What are the disadvantages of stainless steel water tanks?</ins></b>

            <h2 class="text-information-title">Rainwater Harvesting In Residential Area:</h2>
            <p class="text-information">Rooftop rainwater harvesting is the most common rainwater harvesting technique for domestic consumption. In residential areas, this is often done on a small scale. It is a simple, low-cost technique that requires minimal specific expertise or knowledge and offers many benefits. <br>
                Rainwater is collected on the roof and transported by gutters to a storage tank, where it supplies the water at the point of consumption or can be used to recharge a well or aquifer. Rainwater harvesting can replenish water resources when they become scarce or of low quality, such as brackish groundwater or contaminated surface water during the rainy season. However, rainwater quality can be affected by air pollution, animal or bird droppings, insects, dirt, and organic mater. <b>Hence regular maintenance (cleaning, repair, etc.)</b>
            </p>
            <b>Favorable:</b>
            <p class="text-information">Users can maintain and control their own systems without depending on other members of the community.</p>
            <p class="text-information">Local people can easily be trained to build their own reproductive health system. This reduces costs and encourages more participation, ownership and sustainability at the community level .</p>
            <p class="text-information">Rainwater is better than other traditional or readily available sources (groundwater may become unusable due to fluoridation, salinity or arsenic)</p>
            <p class="text-information">It is possible to save the cost of purchasing water and the time of exploitation from the city water supply </p>

When the first rains come, these unwanted substances are washed into the tank. This will cause the water to become contaminated and degrade in quality. As a result, many RWH systems incorporate a system to redirect this 'first flush' water so it doesn't enter the tank. These systems are known as primary discharge devices.</p>

                <p class="text-information">Rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems are gradually becoming part of sustainable water management practices. Rainwater harvesting is a process of collecting, storing and reusing rainwater. Rainwater harvesting is one of the simplest ways for us to live sustainably with nature. Rainwater collection systems work by collecting rainwater from roof gutters, filtering it, and storing the water in a storage tank.</p>
                <p class="text-information">Rainwater extraction is becoming popular leading to ecological conservation. Most commercial buildings use a significant amount of water and energy in their daily operations. Rainwater collection is an old and effective technique of collecting rainwater during the rainy season for later use. The ecological benefit of a rainwater harvesting system for commercial buildings is that it will significantly reduce the amount of water used from the grid.</p>

                <p class="text-information">Surface rainwater harvesting and rooftop harvesting are the two main rainwater harvesting methods where rooftop harvesting is the most preferred rainwater harvesting method for commercial buildings. The basic components of this system are: basin, gutter, down pipe, storage tank and distribution system. The catchment area that receives direct rainfall where downspouts and pipes bring water from the surface of the basin to a reservoir that may be located above ground or below ground. Finally, the collected rainwater will be filtered and distributed to the point of use through a distribution system.</p>
